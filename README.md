## Name of the Experiment
Study Of Newton Backward Difference Method To Predict Unknown Value(s) For Any Geographic Point Data.
## Objectives
The objective of this experiment is to use Newton backward difference method to find out the very precise values of the given data point, using MATLAB. 
## Theory
The differences y1 – y0, y2 – y1, ……, yn – yn–1 when denoted by dy1, dy2, ……, dyn, respectively, are called first backward difference. Thus the first backward differences are:
